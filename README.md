# Calorie-Counting-Simplified-Android
This is the entire codebase for the mobile version of Calorie Counting Simplified, an app used to help you track your nutrition.

The app is built on the Xamarin platform.  The business logic uses C# and the front-end uses XAML.  SQL is also implemented in the back-end to save data to the user's device.

I developed this application during my Junior and Senior years of high school.  It's my first fleshed-out project of any kind.  While it's a bit of a hackjob, it works.
I consider it a passion project and am quite proud of it.
